# Portable Format for Biomedical Data

**PFB** is a serialization file format designed to store bio-medical data, as well as metadata. The format is built on top [**Avro**][1] to make it fast, extensible and interoperable between different systems.

### What is an Avro File?

A file with data records (JSON) and a schema (JSON) to describe each data record. Avro files can be serialized into a binary format and compressed.

### What is a PFB File?

A PFB file is special kind of Avro file, suitable for capturing and reconstructing biomedical relational data.

A PFB file is an Avro file with a particular Avro schema that represents a relational database. We call this schema the [PFB Schema](#schema).

The data in a PFB file contains a list of JSON objects called PFB Entity objects. There are 2 types of PFB Entities. One (Metadata) captures information about the relational database and the other (Table Row) captures a row of data from a particular table in the database.

The data records in a PFB file are produced by transforming the original data from a relational database into PFB Entity objects. Each PFB Entity object conforms to its Avro schema.

### Vanilla Avro vs PFB

Let's say a client receives an Avro file. It reads in the Avro data. Now a client has the Avro schema and all of the data that conforms to that schema in a big JSON blob. It can do what it wants. Maybe it wants to construct some data input forms. It has everything it needs to do this since the schema has all of the entities, attributes, and types for those attributes defined.

Now what happens if the client wants to reconstruct a relational database from the data? How does it know what tables to create, and what the relationships are between those tables? Which relationships are required vs not? This is one of the problems PFB addresses.

## Schema

**PFB** file is consist of list of **Entities**, where **Entity** is a container type (it stores the actual data) in *object* field. The *id*, *name* and *relations* fields used for linking each entity to other entities in the PFB file. The *relations* consists of a destination *id* and *name*: so each entity is linked to some other entity (*note*, there is no backward links). The *id* and *relations* is only relevant for clinical data, so for **Metadata** entity it's `null`.

The only entity which is required in the PFB file is **Metadata**: it describes the data model linking and stores ontology references to make interoperability with other systems easier. For each node and fields multiple links to ontologies can exists. The ontology is user defined and it's possible to perform a schema evolution on the PFB file to harmonize all of the data to a single version of a given ontology.

The Avro IDL for **Metadata**:

```
record Metadata {
    array<Node> nodes;
    map<string> misc;
}
```

With `Node` and `Property` defined as:

```
record Node {
    string name;
    string ontology_reference;
    map<string> values;
    array<Link> links;
    array<Property> properties;
}

record Property {
    string name;
    string ontology_reference;
    map<string> values;
}
```

In both `Node` and `Property` the `name` is the name of the field in the data model, `ontology_reference` stores the name for ontology reference (any ontology, e.g. [NCIt][2], [caDSR][3]) and `values` stores any additional field regarding ontology: URL, ontology codes, synonyms etc. Same for `Property`.

In addition, inside *links* for `Node` it's important to specify the linkage for the nodes: destination and multiplicity.

The `Link` and `Multiplicity` enum is presented below:
```
record Link {
    Multiplicity multiplicity;
    string dst;
}

enum Multiplicity {
    ONE_TO_ONE,
    ONE_TO_MANY,
    MANY_TO_ONE,
    MANY_TO_MANY
}
```

### Types

#### Enum

Because Avro can't store anything except alphanumeric and `_` symbols, all enums are encoded in such a way, that all other symbols is being encoded with codepoint wrapped in single underscores. For example `bpm > 60` will be encoded in: `bpm_32__62__32_60`, so space ` ` is encoded as `_32_` and greater sign `>` into `_62_`. Same for Unicode characters: `ä` - `_228_`, `ü` - `_252_`. The Avro schema also doesn't allow for the first character to be a number. So we encode the first character in the way if the character happens to be a number.

## Example

The schema on the image below shows the simplest model with only **Demographic** data.
